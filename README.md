# Project Genesis

Genesis is the starting dataset for your bible search bar. It includes New Testament and Old Testament with every verse, every chapter and every book. 

Current dataset include these formats: 

- yaml
- json
- xml

TODO 
- include more shorten bible titles found in "others"

- include parsing of multiple verses or chapters: 
   e.g. john 1:3-8 or john 1:3~8 or john 1-3 

- Consider changing json structure. Changing current json structure into array. ie remove "1" or "66" into [{},{},{}]
